On the main screen, you will see the names of the five most popular animes on the left. On the right you can see the titles and images of the animes, sorted by their names. You can scroll down to see more, but the maximum number of results is 10. There is a search bar at the top. When you press any title or image on the left or right, you will be directed to the information page for that anime.

Pressing the chat button will take you to a login page where you can choose your own name. Chat also has a logout button.
